## Must Reads

Clean Agile
This reads more like a memoir but a nice refresher on basics and history of Agile
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07XTL99JQ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_d_asin_title_o01?ie=UTF8&psc=1

Clean Craftsmanship
The Ethics portion is the shortest part and worth the whole price of the book
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B095C16LSW/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_d_asin_title_o01?ie=UTF8&psc=1

You Don't Know JS
The second edition is being worked on but the first edition still applies. This gets you down into the nitty gritty of js. It's a lot of content so you're going to want to take this in pieces.

## Eventually Read

Clean Code
Super java focused but the concepts apply. I've only read the first half and skimmed the remainder once it got super java focused. On my list for a reread though
